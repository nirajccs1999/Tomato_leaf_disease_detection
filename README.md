# Tomato_leaf_disease_detection
Detect and classify tomato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing images of diseased and healthy tomato leaves. Train the model to identify various diseases affecting tomato plants. Additionally, the system suggests remedies for the particular disease detected, contributing to the improvement of crop health.

## Dataset
Download the dataset here ('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirajkumar9649/tomato-leaf-disease-detection-using-cnn') and organize it into training, testing, and validation sets.

## Files
cnn.py: Contains the CNN model architecture for tomato leaf disease detection.
app.py: Implements a Flask web application for user interaction and displaying results.

##HTML Pages
index.html: Main page for general interaction with the tomato leaf disease detection system.
userlog.html: Page for uploading images, and accessing disease name and remedies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download and organize the dataset.
3. Train the model using cnn.py.
4. Run the Flask web application with app.py.
   
## Usage
1. Visit the web application at http://localhost:5000.
2. Log in using your credentials on the userlog.html page.
3. Upload an image of a tomato leaf to detect diseases.
4. View personalized features and results on the same page.
