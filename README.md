# Tomato_leaf_disease_detection
Detect and classify tomato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing images of diseased and healthy tomato leaves. Train the model to identify various diseases affecting tomato plants and contribute to the improvement of crop health.
